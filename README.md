# Health insurance loss during COVID-19 increases support for Universal Health Coverage

This repository provides the data and code that supports the findings of a study "Health insurance loss during COVID-19 increases support for Universal Health Coverage" published at Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law (JHPPL). The study is based on a survey on health care access during the COVID-19 pandemic conducted in June 2020. The aim of this survey was to examine how different ways of presenting information about universal health coverage affects people’s attitudes about moving the predominately private US health system in the direction of public health insurance coverage. “Single-payer,” Medicare-for-All health insurance proposals have recently risen on the policy agenda and different plans are being advanced by various political candidates. Yet, while Medicare-for-All is generally supported by a solid majority of the American public in opinion polls, public support depends heavily on how information about the financing of the plan is presented, and the potential costs and benefits. Opponents of single-payer, notably the private health insurance industry, often play off of popular fears about public health insurance, such as the idea that it might increase wait times for appointments and lower the quality of health care. The goal of this research is to test various message framings about single-payer and see how this affects support with the idea to identify messages that will be most persuasive and detrimental towards advancing single-payer.
